# Introduction [my inspiration story]
- I am an online dictionary containing 3 languages namely: English, Swahili AKA Kiswahili, and Sheng [the Kenyan slang].
- I was created to be used by:
	> A person having difficulty translating from one of the 3 languages to another.
	> A person who wants to learn any of the listed languages.
	> Someone who wants to embrace and continually use the 3 listed languages.
- I was born from the idea of having a reference to the key languages spoken in my country.
- Thus I am also called 3-in-1 aka Triolingo.
